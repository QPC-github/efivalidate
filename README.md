# `efivalidate`

`efivalidate` is a ruby utility to take a given input EFI payload from macOS and to compare it against
Apple's validation schema.  Being written in ruby this can occur off-box to ensure that the utility itself
hasn't been compromised

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'efivalidate'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install efivalidate

## Usage

    $ efivalidate

    Usage: efivalidate {input.bin} [PARAMS]

      {input.bin} is a EFI payload saved using either `eficheck` or `BootRomFlash.efi`

      --download-signatures

          Attempts to download Apple's EFI signatures from their update service

      --signatures-path

          Points to a path on disk where known EFI signatures exist
